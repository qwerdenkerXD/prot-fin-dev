# Meeting Notes from 01.07.2024

Priorities bis zum 8. Juli:
- padding und normalization with an extra "+ 1"
- redo family matching with latest method
  - padding
  - first hash appearance
    - test with first appearance and with last (current method) appearance
  - test for different quantiles of hash frequencies:
    - 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 1.0
    - report db sizes and running speed with those
- redo single protein matching with latest methods
  - test with first appearance and with last (current method) appearance

Priorities for BA, 15th July:
- read Schultz BA about Scoring Algorithms !
  important for your Bachelor Thesis
- We could extend our matches from tuple (window-ind, prot-id) to
  (array of window-indices, prot-id).
  When we have estimates of the distribution of hash
  per protein frequencies, we can calculate how long our array of window-indices
  will be:
  ```py
  # see below pseudo-code for "hash_per_prot_freqs"
  curr_size = number(hashes) * (size_of_int, mean(size_of_prot_id * size_of_utf8_char))  # assume 1 Byte for utf8
  new_size = number(hashes) * (hash_per_prot_freqs * size_of_int, mean(size_of_prot_id * size_of_utf8_char))
  ```

Future Perspectives:

- Should the family matching after the above corrections still have a bad performance,
  we should try out the Computerphile matching and scoring instead of our hashes.

Rough sketch of this "Computerphile Hashing":
- it is just window based no longer pairs of frequencies, single frequencies instead
- Hash is generated from (i) frequency and (ii) whether it has been selected in the upper or lower tail (one digit)
- appearances model stores hashes and protein-Id and arrays of window indices
- we would need to invent a new scoring algorithm:
  - query protein sort hashes by window appearance
  - find longest chain of matches with any hit in the database
  - score such chains of matches, can be inspired by the BA of Schultz:
     - neighbor windows give extra score
     - max distance (target zone) to allow a chain to have gaps, where no hash is matched
     - ...
