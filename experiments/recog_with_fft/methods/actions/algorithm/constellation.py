    The function carries out a windowed fast fourier transformation,
    often called short time FFT (STFT), on the given vector and creates a list
    of frequencies, found by the STFT, and the index of the window they are found

    ...

    Parameter
    ---------
    aa_vec : np.ndarray
        An array of floats representing an amino acid sequence
    window_size : int
        size of a window, related to amino acids -> size 2 means two amino acids
    n_peaks : int, optional
        the number of frequency peaks that are selected from the STFT result,
        if 0 then all are selected (defaults to 0)
    window : str
        The window type for the STFT, read https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.get_window.html#scipy.signal.get_window
        for supported ones (defaults to "boxcar")
    **kwargs:
        overlap : int
            the overlap between two windows during doing the STFT (defaults to half the window size)

    Returns
    -------
     A ConstellationMap, a list of coordinates, meaning the pairs of
     window index and prominent frequency peak of the window
