# Recognition with Fast Fourier Transformation
`NOTE: This README and the code are updated synchronously.`

The concept of this experiment is to generate a vector of values from an amino acid sequence, using one factor of [the table of Kidera factors](../../materials/Amino_Acid_Kidera_Factors.csv), for now. These factors represent the 10 most identifying features of amino acids.<br>
With doing a Short Time Fourier Transformation (STFT) on the created vector, it is now possible to find structual features in the sequence to create a specific constellation of them.

Now, instead of looking on text-based likelihood, the goal is to identify a protein by its own sequence from this constellation, so it needs to be unique like a fingerprint, but still similar to related sequences of the same family and less similar to others.

## Usage
1. go to `./methods`
2. create a database of reference proteins: `python3 protfin.py create-db <ref-fasta>`
3. find best scored matches for protein sequence samples: `python3 protfin.py find-match <samples-fasta>`

## Results (`results/*`)
|                          file                            |     content
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------
|[test_selection.summary.csv](./results/test_selection.summary.csv)|a summary of the found matches for 217 protein sequences (7 per family)

### Reproduce
In this repository, `protein.fa` is used to generate the database. You can extract the file from [this archive](https://github.com/usadellab/prot-fin/raw/5be77c4247327e3958c89200c03a938ec4734834/material/Mapman_reference_DB_202310.tar.bz2). The archive also includes `mapmanreferencebins.results.txt` which maps the proteins to their families.

The used table of Kidera factors is located in [../../materials/Amino_Acid_Kidera_Factors.csv](../../materials/Amino_Acid_Kidera_Factors.csv) and was generated by [this R-script](https://github.com/usadellab/prot-fin/blob/5be77c4247327e3958c89200c03a938ec4734834/methods/Amino_Acid_Kidera_Factors.R). (Read the [root-README](../../README.md) for more details).

[test_selection.summary.csv](./results/test_selection.summary.csv):
```sh
cd methods
materials=../../../materials
python3 protfin.py create-db $materials/protein.fa
python3 evaluation.py select-samples $materials/mapmanreferencebins.results.txt $materials/protein.fa -s 7 > ../results/_test_selection.fa
python3 protfin.py find-match ../results/_test_selection.fa > ../results/_test_selection.matches
python3 evaluation.py eval ../results/_test_selection.matches > ../results/test_selection.summary.csv
```

## Discussion/Brainstorming
The summary implies that longer sequences have a more accurate result than shorter ones. As the recognition is based on hash similarities, this implication is not that unexpected, as longer sequences produce more hashes. Interesting here is that same hash counts seem to cause the same match counts.<br>
To increase the general accuracy of the algorithm, the hash creation has to be more quantitative or better, more qualitative.

Some ideas for future development:
 - add appropriate testing
 - find ways to create more hashes or to increase their quality
   - find the best combination of parameters for the STFT $\rightarrow$ maybe more hashes
   - don't just use the peaks only (`create_constellations`) $\rightarrow$ maybe more hashes
   - include the frequencies' amplitudes of the STFT in the hashes (maybe 1 Bit if amplitude of frequency A is lower than from B) $\rightarrow$ maybe better quality
